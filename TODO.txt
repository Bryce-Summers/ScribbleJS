Handle uncomplemented faces.
Determine why face segmentation for spiral produces correct and incorrect results depending on the run.

Add Screenshots of all examples.
Construct an index.html website for viewing the examples online.

Handle the embedding and intersection of degenerate inputs, such as collinear lines.

Especially axis aligned boxes that
+---+----+---+
|   |    |   |  (Two Overlapping, aligned boxes.)

Write some explicit tests for BVH's and Halfedge Meshes, such as validty checking.
Test Removal and addition of lines and faces from BVH's.
Handle the display off internal islands in the examples.

Implement 4 or 5 coloring and the selection of a pleasing array of colors.

Think about better example images.


Spruce up the examples:
 - Use a well thougght out color scheme.
 - For line splitting, enable the user to draw lines point by point.
 - For face finding, perhaps allow the user to draw lines.
 - For bvh formation, highlight the boxes in the bvh that their cursor is intersecting.
   Think about Line weights and styles.
 - For the eraser tool, sort the faces by area, to make sure internal islands get drawn on top of containing faces.

 - In the line embedding, I need to check for self-intersections.

 -  I need to make line segment intersection work for algorithms that want a unique listing of intersection points across diverse arrays, and people looking for a single line full splitting.
"# FIXME: This line needs to be ommited for some examples and given for others.

 # It appears that there are some degenerate intersection problems in the Bezier curve example, when the 100 is ommitted.
 # It will be fruitful to address intersections at some point.
